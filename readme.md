This code is a volcano simulator, I made it for a school project!.

making many things over here!
# To run the code:

Go into `setup.py`, and run it to ensure all dependencies are installed

To run the code, I made a bash script to start the streamlit server automatically, this however does not work perfectly on every single senario, therefore I would recomend you oppen a terminal and navigate to the source folder. 

There, you can run `streamlit run mainStreamlit.py` and the server will start that way.

A webpage should start automatically, but if it does not start automatically, go to [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501/)

I hope you learn something from this project.
